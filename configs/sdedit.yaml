# SDEdit Configuration
# Based on: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01073

# Score Network Architecture
channels: 128
num_scales: 10

# Training Parameters
epochs: 50
lr: 0.001
batch_size: 128

# Noise Levels (geometric progression from sigma_max to sigma_min)
sigmas: [0.01, 1.0]

# SDEdit Specific Parameters
# t0: Controls the trade-off between realism and faithfulness
# - Higher t0 (closer to 1): More noise added, more realistic but less faithful to guide
# - Lower t0 (closer to 0): Less noise added, more faithful but potentially less realistic
# Recommended values: 0.3-0.7 depending on the application
t0: 0.5

# Sampling Parameters
n_steps: 100  # Number of Langevin steps per noise level
eps: 0.00002  # Base step size for Langevin dynamics
